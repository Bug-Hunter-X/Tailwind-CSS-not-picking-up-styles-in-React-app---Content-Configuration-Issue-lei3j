# Tailwind CSS Content Configuration Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS: styles not being applied because of an incorrectly configured `content` option in `tailwind.config.js`.

**Problem:**

Tailwind CSS fails to recognize and apply styles from components.  The class names appear to be correct, but Tailwind doesn't seem to find them.

**Solution:**

The problem often stems from an incorrect or incomplete `content` array. This array needs to specify all the files where your Tailwind classes are used.  It's crucial to ensure that the paths in `content` accurately reflect the file structure of your project.

**How to reproduce:**

1. Clone this repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages.
3. Try to run the app (instructions might vary depending on the project setup, e.g., using `npm start` or a similar command).
4. Observe that some or all Tailwind CSS styles are not applied.

**How to fix:**

1. Carefully review and update the `content` array in the `tailwind.config.js` file to include all relevant directories and file types.  Ensure paths are accurate and complete.
2. If the issue persists, verify that your Tailwind CSS configuration is correctly set up and integrated into your build process.
